# Speaking-Clock-MP3-Files

This repository contains two sets of MP3 files created for a speaking clock project.
They contain enough phrases to announce the time, tell you to wake up, have morning
tea and lunch as well as a few others.

They are free to download and use in your own projects.

More info about these files and creating your own is available on my blog:
